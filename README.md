## Description
This repository contains the project work for CMSE 495. This is the capstone for the data science and computational data science programs at Michigan State University, taught by Dr. Dirk Colbry.  Throughout the semester we will be working with our community partner, Grassroots Midwest, to provide a deliverable that meets their expectations. As the project develops, we will be adding and altering files that show our findings.

The objective of this project is to build a data viewer that leverages a de-identified clone of Grassroots Midwest's Google Cloud database. The tool will focus on visualizing the relationships between different entities—such as contacts, companies, and projects—within the organization.

The webpage will have an individual lookup page where you can search for an individual's contact information as well as generate an interactive relationship map as well as a page for companies.

## Community Partner
Grassroots Midwest is a political consulting firm that specializes in relationship management and voter outreach across Michigan. The firm maintains a vast database of information on companies, their employees, projects they have collaborated on, and other relationship data. This data is stored within their Google Cloud database and software stack. The organization seeks to enhance their ability to visualize and analyze these relationships through a custom data viewer tool.

## Installation
- Follow the steps in the [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) file for installation. 
- To run it after installation, use the Running Instructions within the [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) file.

## Usage
The webpage will search people within the database and showcase their contact information and a graph can be generated of the connection that person has with others within the database. There is also a page for company look up which will have the contact information for a company and a graph can be generated of the connections that people have with that company.
